# GrEn
## The **Gr**aphics **En**gine
GrEn is a *user-friendly* C/C++ Graphics Engine Framework for 2D and 3D. It is still being built and changed and is not close to be finished yet.

## Features
* Handeling of multiple windows simultaniously
* Abilitty to use general 2D objects to draw them on screen
(kinda empty :P)

## Upcoming Features
* Upgrading the window to something more robust
* Abilitty to perform vector/matrix operations

## Invisioned features
* Having control over simple 3D meshes that can be rendered on screen
* Optimized rendering pipeline(first running only on CPU)
* Simple light sources
* Simple material control
* More will be added :D

## Status
### Some background
Back some years ago I tried to build an engine and I had done a lot of mistakes back then which resulted in an engine that worked but with trash performance. So now I've come to fix this and build a better engine :)
### My way to go
Currently I am working on having this work for CPU. Only when I will get it to run in a way I like it enough, Then progress on GPU integration will start. GPU integration will be using CUDA(~~no AMD~~) :D
